# Introductory Angular Lab

The following challenges are designed to introduce you to Angular:
* Setting up an angular application
* Rendering data
* Creating a module
* Creating controllers
* Passing values between the controllers and views
* Two-way data-binding & view-models

#### Setup
For each challenge, open the corresponding `index.html` page in your browser. E.g. `challenge_1/index.html`

On each challenge page, follow the instructions to setup angular. Then move on to the exercises.

You will need to make changes in `index.html` and `app.js`.

> Keep your Chrome Developer Console open, and make sure you're working in the correct file!

#### Challenges
1. Rendering Data in Angular
2. Using Controllers to hide logic
    * Render data about yourself
    * Render data about your class
3. Two-Way Data-binding
    * Play with view-models (ng-model)
    * Create a simple calculator
    * Create a loan interest calculator

1 month accrued and total are the same.

2 month accured is based off the percentage from 1st month total, then 2nd month total is 1 month total plus 2nd month accrued
